\textit{``People say to me: are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics? No, I'm not. I'm just looking to find
out more about the world and if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law that explains everything--so be it. That would be very nice to discover. 
If it turns out its like an onion with millions of layers and we're just sick and tired of looking at the layers.
Then that's the way it is. But whatever way it comes out its nature that's there and she's going to come out the way she is. 
Therefore when we go to investigate it, we shouldn't pre-decide what we want to find out besides to find
out more about it.  You see -- one thing is, I can live with doubt, and uncertainty 
and not knowing. I think its much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers that might be wrong. 
I have approximate answers and possible beliefs, and different degrees of certainty about different things, but I'm
not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about. 
But I don't have to know an answer. I don't have to. I don't feel frightened by not knowing things.''}
