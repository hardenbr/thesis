in progress

This thesis would not have been possible without the input of many.
First, I would like to thank my advisor Dan Marlow, who has guided me through five years of
graduate study. I have enjoyed and profited from our conversations related
to all things physics and, occasionally, to life. I have seen that doing research at times involves
more than doing physics, and Dan's advice in navigating the bureaucracies created by
CMS and the Graduate School has been refreshingly helpful.

I would like to thank the professors in the Princeton Physics Department, in particular to Chris Tully
for discussions related to this thesis and for reading this thesis and to Igor Klebanov
and Peter Meyers for serving on committees for my FPO and pre-thesis project.

From my time at Purdue as an undergraduate, I would like to thank my advisor Daniela Bortoletto and
Artur Apresyan. Through our work at CDF, their influence and patience gave me strong desire to
see just how deep the rabbit hole goes (through graduate study).
%particle physics was an interesting and worthwhile endeavor.

At CERN, I have had the priveledge to work with many talented physicists. In the HggHbb group,
through which the main result of this thesis was achieved, I have had the pleasure to collaborate with
Olivier Bondu, Maxime Gouzevitch, Chiara Rovelli, Badder Marzocchi, Alexandra Oliveira, and
Amina Zghiche. I would especially like to thank Olivier for forcing the use of GitHub in our group,
ultimately making collabration easier and more enjoyable.

I owe thanks to many others with whom I have collaborated on other CMS projects.
Of the 4000 authors that comprise the CMS author list, I would like to single out the following
who have contributed in some way to my time at CMS:
from the luminosity subsystem Nadia Adam, Andrzej Zuranski, Adam Hunt, and Paul Lujan;
from the Pixel Luminosity Telescope Dean Hidas, Steve Schnetzer, Bob Stone, Andreas Kornmayer, and Andres Delannoy;
from the $W'$ analysis Christos Leonidopoulos and Sunghyun Chang;
from the $VH(b\bar{b})$ analysis Seth Zenz and Michael Mooney.

I would like to thank the friends over the years who have made life as, or sometimes more, interesting
than my physics life. These include, in some nonrandom order,
<people> cern, princeton, 400
I would also like to thank Tuna, Kurt, Josh, and Josh for contributing to multiple versions
of our CERN relay team and, in turn, creating a true American dynasty. Heros are forged in the fire.

La langue française occupe un endoit special pendant le temps que j'ai passé comme doctorant.
Au moment que j'ai su que je démenagerais à Genève, j'ai commencé à l'apprendre avec l'aide de
plusieurs personnes patientes à Princeton et à Genève, des amis ainsi que des professeurs.
Je remercie <people> french friends en français (teachers, croix rouge, roberto, emilie).

I would like to thank my family whom I have been very fortunate to have by my side through ups and
downs. To my brothers, through many years of laughing and fighting, 
To my parents, waaa

Finally, to my fiancée Jigisha Darbha, thanks. Your companionship has provided me much opportunity
to grow as a person and has served as a sanity check.
I am excited that we will soon be on the same team. And as always, I ask for your patience
while I slowly learn the language of your ancestors. I look forward to many more adventures
to come.
