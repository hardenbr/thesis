%Matching the muons to the tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a transverse momentum
%resolution between 1 and 5\,\% for \pt values up to 1~TeV. The ECAL has an energy resolution better
%than 0.5\% for unconverted photons with transverse energies above 100~GeV.
%The HCAL, when combined with the ECAL, measures jets with a resolution
%$\Delta E/E \approx 100\,\% / \sqrt{E\,[\gev]} \oplus 5\,\%$.
