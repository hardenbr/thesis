\subsection{Funding Model}

The CERN operating budget provided by the individual member states. The size of the contribution is determined:
\begin{quote}
``using the arithmetic average of three years of Net National
Income values until year before last year and applying the corresponding annual average
exchange rate for each year''
\end{quote}
Here the Net National Income is defined as:

The bunches of protons in the LHC are bent into a circular trajectory by more than 1200
 superconducting dipole magnets and are focused and maintained close to the ideal
 orbit around the ring by hundreds of superconducting quadrupole magnets. 
Thousands of corrector magnets around the ring allow the beam to be steered closer 
to the ideal orbit, make the focusing independent of the particles’ energy variations
 within a bunch, and cancel the effects of higher order multipoles in the fields induced 
by small field imperfections in the main magnets. 
The radiofrequency (RF) field in superconducting cavities is placed periodically around 
the ring and accelerates the protons from the injection energy of 450 GeV to the final
 operating energy, which is designed to be 7 TeV per beam. The RF field also causes the
 protons to be bunched, as only particles at or near a certain ”equilibrium phase” on 
the RF wave will be accelerated stably. Special quadrupoles around each interaction region
 focus the bunches down to a small transverse size, to increase the likelihood of a
 proton-proton collision each time two bunches pass through each other.
