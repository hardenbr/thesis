\chapter{Event Selection\label{ch:selection}}

After preselection requirements are imposed, photons and jets necessary to construct the $\Hgg$ and $\Hbb$ candidates present. This chapter discusses additional event-wide requirements imposed to further
improve the sensitiviy to selecting the signal of interest over the background contributions.
Section~\ref{sec:higgsreconstruction} discusses how the photons and jets passing the preselection
requirements are assembled into Higgs candidates. For the resonant search $X\rightarrow HH$,
Section~\ref{sec:Xreconstruction} discusses how the two Higgs come together to construct a resonant
candidate. Event classification is covered in Section~\ref{sec:classification}, which provides
another opportunity to improve the search sensitivity. Finally, the construction of a data control
sample, discussed in Section~\ref{sec:dataCS}, allows for the study of additional event-wide
requirements for improving sensitivity, discussed in Section~\ref{sec:optim}.

\section{Higgs Reconstruction\label{sec:higgsreconstruction}}
talk about photon choice, jet choice

The  Higgs  boson  candidate  is  reconstructed  in  the  medium-purity  events  by  pairing  the  b-
tagged jet with the non b-tagged jet giving largest
p
T
of the pair.  For the high-purity events
the pair of b-tagged jets giving the largest
p
T
for the Higgs candidate is used.  This procedure
selects the correct jets in more than 80% of the cases and does not produce any local peaking
structure in the background.
The resulting signal mass shape of the Higgs candidate decaying into two b-quarks is shown on
the Figure 1 (top-right). For the high-purity category, the typical resolution, defined as the half-
width at half-maximum, decreases from 20 GeV at
m
X
=
300 GeV to 15 GeV at
m
X
=
1 TeV. In
the medium-purity category, the resolution is worse, decreasing from 25 GeV at
m
X
=
300 GeV
to 15 GeV at
m
X
=
1 TeV.

\section{Event Classification\label{sec:classification}}
 The working point used for signal extraction the medium one (CSVM),
which corresponds to an efficiency of around 60--70\%
and a mistag rate 1--2\%, depending on the jet $p_{\rm T}$.
There is also a tight working point (CSVT) which corresponds to ta mistag rate of 0.1\%.

In order to improve the signal sensitivity, events are classified into three categories
based on the number of CSVM b-tagged jets. Events with two or more b-tags, called high purity,
drive the sensitivity of the search. Events with one b-tag, called medium purity,
bring low contribution but allow for increased signal acceptance. Events without any b-tags,
called low purity, are only used for cross-checks and are rejected from the main analysis.
