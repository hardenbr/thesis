\chapter{Event Selection\label{ch:selection}}

This section describes how we got from events with collections of photons and jets to 2 higgs candidates, and in the resonant case to a resonant candidate

\section{Higgs Reconstruction\label{sec:higgsreconstruction}}
talk about photon choice, jet choice

The  Higgs  boson  candidate  is  reconstructed  in  the  medium-purity  events  by  pairing  the  b-
tagged jet with the non b-tagged jet giving largest
p
T
of the pair.  For the high-purity events
the pair of b-tagged jets giving the largest
p
T
for the Higgs candidate is used.  This procedure
selects the correct jets in more than 80% of the cases and does not produce any local peaking
structure in the background.
The resulting signal mass shape of the Higgs candidate decaying into two b-quarks is shown on
the Figure 1 (top-right). For the high-purity category, the typical resolution, defined as the half-
width at half-maximum, decreases from 20 GeV at
m
X
=
300 GeV to 15 GeV at
m
X
=
1 TeV. In
the medium-purity category, the resolution is worse, decreasing from 25 GeV at
m
X
=
300 GeV
to 15 GeV at
m
X
=
1 TeV.
