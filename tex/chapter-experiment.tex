\section{LHC\label{sec:LHC}}
\subsection{Overview}
The LHC is a $pp$ accelerator that straddles the border between France and Switzerland~\cite{cern-jinst-lhc}. It was installed in a 27 km tunnel with diameter 3.7 m at an average depth of 100 m underground.
The position of this tunnel with respect to nearby political and geographical points of interest is 
shown in Figures~\ref{fig:lhc_mapwithcities,fig:lhc_map_tuna}.
The tunnel was previously
used by the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) from 1989 to 2000 for electron-positron collisions~\cite{LEP_DR1979}.

\end{figure}

The LHC is designed to accelerate protons or ions in two circular beam pipes, orbiting in opposite directions. The pre-accelerators are described in Subsection~\ref{subsec:accelerators}, while the LHC
itself is described in Subsection~\ref{subsec:machine}
These beams are made to cross in four designated points of the accelerator and create collisions between
pairs of particles in opposite beams.
Each of these points is home to a large detector which measures the
products of these collisions, which are described in Subsection~\ref{subsec:detectors}.

\subsection{Accelerator Complex\label{subsec:accelerators}}

The path that a proton takes before entering a collision in the middle of CMS is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:cern_accelerators}. Hydrogen gas is stripped of its electron and accelerated in
Linac2, a linear accelerator, to 50 MeV. Next are a series of three circular pre-accelerators that
increase the kinetic energy of the protons as well as collect the protons into discrete bunches.
These accelerators are the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB), the Proton Synchrotron (PS), and the
Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), which increase the proton's energy to 1.4 GeV, 25 GeV, and 450 GeV,
respectively. 

\begin{figure}[ht]

      \end{center}
\caption{The flow of the CERN accelerator complex~\cite{Jean-Luc:841493}.}
\label{fig:cern_accelerators}
\end{figure}

After the SPS, the protons are injected into the LHC, where they are accelerated to up to 7 TeV.
The bunch structure is maintained during injection into the LHC, which is important for the timing
of the collisions inside the detectors. 

\subsection{The Machine\label{subsec:machine}}

The LHC is made up of 1232 dipole magnets divided by eight insertion points. A cross sectional view
of a dipole is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lhc_dipole}. The purpose of the
dipoles, each of which has two holes for each beam, is to direct the proton beams on their circular
path. To keep these high energy particles on their path, each dipole produces a magnetic field
of 8.3 T using a superconductor cooled with liquid helium to 1.9 K, which allows for a current
of 12 kA. The length and mass of a dipole is 14 m and 35 tons, respectively.

\begin{figure}[ht]

      \end{center}
\caption{Digram of a cross section of an LHC dipole~\cite{Team:40524}.}
\label{fig:lhc_dipole}
\end{figure}

Each insertion point serves a different purpose. Points 1, 2, 5, and 8 are the interaction points, where
the beams overlap to produce collisions. Point 4 contains the radio frequency cavity systems, which
provide acceleration to the particles in the direction of their motion. Points 3 and 7 contain beam
collimation systems. Point 6 contains beam dump systems for removing the beams from the LHC.

\subsection{Detectors on the LHC\label{subsec:detectors}}

The general purpose detectors on the LHC are A Toroidal LHC Apparatus (ATLAS) and CMS, located at opposite sides of the ring at points 1 and 5, respectively. The physics
goals of these two experiements are generally the same: to search for and study the Higgs boson,
to study and improve our understanding of SM processes, and to search for BSM physics such as
SUSY or WED.

The Large Hadron Collider beauty detector (LHCb) is located at point 8 and is used
to study processes related to the bottom quark. A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is located
at point 2 and is used to solely to study collisions when one or both beams contain lead ions. This
mode of operation of the LHC lasts about one to two months per year.

The relative positions of these four detectors on the LHC is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lhc_detectors}.
Although the figure makes it appear that all the experiments are at the same depth, the LHC tunnel is
actually sloped at 1.5 degrees toward Lac Leman, causing the tunnel depth to vary between 50 and 150 m.

\subsection{2012 Running}

The principle physics result described in this work is an analysis of the data taken with the
CMS detector during the operation of the LHC in 2012. During this time, the center-of-mass energy
of the $pp$ collisions was $\sqrt{s} = 8$~TeV, whereas the design center-of-mass energy of
$\sqrt{s} = 14$~TeV will be acheived in future operation of the LHC. 

Of the $10^{11}$ protons in each bunch, only a small number of pairs of protons interact during
a bunch crossing inside CMS, where the beams are squeezed into a smaller transverse region. This number
varies from fill to fill and even within a fill due to conditions in the accelerator. The distribution
of the pileup during 2012 running is given in Figure~\ref{fig:pileup2012}, during which time the
average was 21.

\begin{figure}[ht]
 \begin{center}

      \end{center}
\caption{The average pileup in CMS during 2012~\cite{CMS:lumi}.}
\label{fig:pileup2012}
\end{figure}

The total integrated luminosity delivered to CMS during this time was $23.3$~fb~$^{-1}$.
The evolution of the integrated luminosity delivered to and recorded by CMS is shown in
Figrure~\ref{fig:integratedlumi2012}. The delivered integrated luminosity is the amount of
collisions delivered by the LHC to CMS, and ideally CMS would be able to same all of these collisions.
Due to limitations of the data acquisition chain or availability of each subsystem, discussed in
Sections~\ref{sec:trigger,sec:CMS}, respectively, the amount recorded
is slightly less than the delivered. In 2012, the total recorded luminosity was $21.8$~fb~$^{-1}$.

\caption{The integrated luminosity of $pp$ collisions in CMS during 2012~\cite{CMS:lumi}.}
\label{fig:integratedlumi2012}
\end{figure}

The LHC delivered $pp$ collisions in 2010 and 2011 at $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV,
and these were also recorded by CMS.
Figure~\ref{fig:intlumi101112} shows the total luminosity delivered to CMS in each of these years.
Although the $6.1$~fb~$^{-1}$ of 2011 data is used in many measurements of the Higgs boson and
other SM processes, this analysis of diHiggs production pertains principally to 8~TeV data.

\section{CMS\label{sec:CMS}}

CMS is one of the two general purpose detectors on the LHC. It was built in part
to search for the Higgs boson on the range of masses not already excluded by previous experiments
and by theory, as already discussed in Section~\ref{sec:discovery}. Other physics goals include
the study of aspects of the SM, such as the top quark mass, and the search for BSM physics, such
as supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and dark matter, as already discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:SMshortcomings}.

The CMS coordinate system is defined with the origin at the center of the detector. The $z$-axis
of this coordinate system points in the direction that the counterclockwise beam takes at this origin.
The transverse plane is perpendicular to this axis, with the $x$-axis pointing to the center of the
circle made by the LHC and the $y$-axis pointing vertically upward. The azimuthal angle $\phi$ gives
the angle in the transverse plane as measured counterclockwise from the $x$-axis, and the polar angle
$\theta$ is measured from the $z$-axis. In CMS, as the case with other collider experiments,
a Lorentz-invariant pseudorapidity $\eta$ is used in place of the polar angle. It is given by

\begin{equation}
\eta = -\log\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) .
\end{equation}

The central feature of CMS is its superconducting solenoid magnet~\cite{cms:solenoid}.
At 12.5~m long and with an internal diameter of 6~m, it is the world's largest superconducting magnet.
The superconducting material is niobium-titanium, which is cooled to 4~K and provided with a current
of 18~kA.
It is centered on the IP and provides a uniform magnetic field inside its volume of 3.8~T.
Outside of the solenoid, an iron return yoke returns the magnetic field which escapes the ends
of the cylinder. The field strength in this region is a uniform 2 T.

CMS is described in detail in \cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk} and \cite{Bayatian:922757}.
Here an overview of each of the subsystems
is provided, starting from the closest to the main interation point (IP) and proceeding
radially outward.
Subsection~\ref{subsec:tracker} covers the silicon tracker. Subsection~\ref{subsec:ecal} covers the
electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). Subsection~\ref{subsec:hcal} covers the hadronic calorimeter
(HCAL). After the HCAL is the solenoidal magnet, which, although not directly contributing to the
description of an event, is necessary for measuring the energy of charged particles through
the reconstruction of their tracks. Subsection~\ref{subsec:muonsystem} covers the muon system.

\subsection{Silicon Tracker\label{subsec:tracker}}
Within the field volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker,

\subsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter\label{subsec:ecal}}
a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), 
The ECAL is made up of lead tungstate crystals
These calorimeters provide coverage in pseudo-rapidity up to $|\eta| < 3.0$.


\subsection{Hadronic Calorimeter\label{subsec:hcal}}
and a brass-scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL).
, while the HCAL is made up of layers of
plates of brass and plastic scintillator.
An iron and quartz-fibre \v{C}erenkov hadron calorimeter (HF) covers pseudo-rapidities
$3.0 < |\eta|< 5.0$.

\subsection{Muon System\label{subsec:muonsystem}}
The muons are measured in the pseudo-rapidity range $|\eta|< 2.4$,
with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and
resistive plate chambers.
