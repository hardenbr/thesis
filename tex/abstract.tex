  A search for long-lived particles decaying to jets is
  presented, performed on the data collected by CMS at a
  center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV in 2015. The data set
  corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 fb$^{-1}$. The analysis
  exploits a set of trigger algorithms and a customized displaced-jet
  tagger.  The number of tagged displaced-jets is used to characterize
  a potential signal.  The pair production of long-lived particles
  decaying to two jets or to a b jet and a lepton is excluded for
  masses lighter than $450$--$1000$~GeV, for lifetimes between
  $1$~mm to $1$~m.
