A search for the production of Higgs pairs in the decay channel
$HH \rightarrow \gamma\gamma b\bar{b}$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV is reported, both for
resonant production and non-resonant production. The event sample corresponds to an integrated
luminosity of 19.7 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV collected by the
CMS detector. The candidate events are selected by requiring two photons and two jets and classified
according to the number of jets tagged as coming from the hadronization of b-quarks.
The search for a new particle X is performed in the range $260 < m_X < 1100$ GeV. The observations
are {\bf to be unblinded} with expectations from standard model processes.
The search for non-resonant production is performed for anomalous couplings
$\kappa_{t}$, $\kappa_{\lambda}$ and $c_2$.
The observations are {\bf to be unblinded} with expectations from standard model processes.
Upper limits at 95 $\%$ confidence-level are extracted on new particles production cross-section
as well as on a potential non-resonant excess with respect to the Standard Model production.
Those results are subsequently compared to different theories beyond the Standard Model.
