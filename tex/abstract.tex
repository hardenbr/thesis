A search for the production of Higgs pairs in the decay channel
$HH \rightarrow \gamma\gamma b\bar{b}$ is reported both for
resonant and nonresonant production. The data corresponds to an integrated
luminosity of 19.7 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV collected by the
CMS detector at the CERN Large Hardron Collider.
The candidate events are selected by requiring two photons and two jets and are classified
according to the number of jets tagged as coming from the hadronization of b-quarks.
The search for resonance production through a new particle $X$, as hypothesized in extensions
to the Standard Model involving the Radion or KK-graviton from models with warped extra dimensions
or a heavy Higgs from models with supersymmetry,
is performed on the range $260 < m_X/\text{GeV} < 1100$.
The observations are {\bf to be unblinded}.
The search for nonresonant production is performed for anomalous couplings
$\kappa_{t}$, $\kappa_{\lambda}$ and $c_2$.
The observations are {\bf to be unblinded}.
Upper limits at 95 $\%$ confidence level are extracted on the production cross section
as well as on a potential nonresonant excess with respect to the Standard Model production.
These results are subsequently compared to different theories of beyond the Standard Model physics.
