 A search for long-lived particles was performed with data corresponding to
 an integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb$^{-1}$ collected at a center-of-mass energy of 
13 TeV by the CMS experiment in 2015.  The analysis exploits two customized topological
 trigger algorithms and an offline displaced-jet tagging algorithm. The 
 multiplicity of displaced jets is used to search for the presence of a signal with a
 proper lifetime between 1 mm and 1000 mm.  Pair-produced long-lived decays to four-jet
 final states, with cross sections larger
 than 1.2 fb are excluded for a proper lifetime  of 50 mm. For pair-produced long-lived decays
 to two b quarks and two leptons with equal decay rates between lepton flavors,  cross
 sections larger than 2.5 fb are excluded for proper lifetimes between 70 mm and 100 mm. As a mass 
 exclusion bound, pair-produced long-lived R-parity violating top squarks lighter than
 550--1130 GeV are excluded depending on their lifetime and decay mode. This mass exclusion bound
 is currently the most stringent bound available for top squark proper lifetimes greater than 3 mm.
