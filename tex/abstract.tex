A search for the production of Higgs pairs in the decay channel
$HH \rightarrow \gamma\gamma b\bar{b}$ is reported both for
resonant and nonresonant production. The data corresponds to an integrated
luminosity of 19.7 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV collected by the
CMS detector. The candidate events are selected by requiring two photons and two jets and are classified
according to the number of jets tagged as coming from the hadronization of b-quarks.
The search for a new particle $X$ is performed in the range $260 < m_X/\text{GeV} < 1100$.
The observations
are {\bf to be unblinded}.
The search for nonresonant production is performed for anomalous couplings
$\kappa_{t}$, $\kappa_{\lambda}$ and $c_2$.
The observations are {\bf to be unblinded}.
Upper limits at 95 $\%$ confidence-level are extracted on new particles production cross section
as well as on a potential nonresonant excess with respect to the Standard Model production.
These results are subsequently compared to different theories of beyond the Standard Model physics.
