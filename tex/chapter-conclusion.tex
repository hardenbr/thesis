342 A search for the production of Higgs pairs is performed by the CMS Collaboration in the decay
channel HH ! ggb¯b using 19.7 fb􀀀1 of pp collisions collected at
p
343 s = 8 TeV, both for resonant
344 and non-resonant production.
345 The masses under consideration ranges between mX = 260 and mX = 1100 GeV for the resonant
searches. A fit simultaneous to the mgg and mr
jj distributions or to the mkin

tion are performed for resonance masses respectively below and above 400 GeV. The selected
events 348 are split into two categories according to the number of jets tagged as coming from the
349 hadronization of b-quarks, and the results of the search in each category are combined. The
350 observations are compatible with expectations from standard-model processes. Upper limits
351 at 95% confidence-level are extracted on the cross-section of new particles production. The
352 limits are compared to the predictions from theories beyond the standard model, based on the
353 assumption of the existence of warped extra dimension. The radion, under the assumptions
354 described and with LR = 1 TeV is observed (expected) to be excluded with masses below
355 ??? TeV (0.88 TeV) as well as the RS1 KK-graviton with masses between ??? and ??? GeV.
356 A fit simultaneous to the mgg and mjj distributions is performed for the non-resonant search.
357 We exclude a non-resonant production with a SM-like kinematics with a cross section above
358 XXX pb-1 that corresponds to ??? times the SM cross section. In the case only the trilinear
359 Higgs coupling is allowed to variate we exclude the values of self coupling corresponding to
360 a modificator kl =???. We also constrain the parameter space of the case where the linear and
361 quadratic coupling of Higgs bosons can be anomalous ???? excess is found. These results can
362 be used to constrain specific theories.
